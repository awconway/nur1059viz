<p>In this workshop, we will be using a free, open-source software program called <code>R</code>. You wonâ€™t need to install any software on your computer - we will be working entirely online through a web browser. Please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/</a>. You can make an account directly on RStudio Cloud, or use single-sign-on with Google.</p>
