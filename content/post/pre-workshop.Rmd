In this workshop, we will be using a free, open-source software program called `R`. You won't need to install any software on your computer - we will be working entirely online through a web browser. Please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/. You can make an account directly on RStudio Cloud, or use single-sign-on with Google.
